throws an error and returns false on failure

builtins.รถ can't be ran like imported files because:
	* importing may set errors, but they're not available when running builtins.รถ because it defines those errors
	* builtins.รถ must be ran directly in the built-in scope
	* other files may contain any utf8 characters, but utf8_decode() also uses the errors

this is in the same place with import stuff because reading and running the file is similar
